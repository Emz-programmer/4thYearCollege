# Sensors

## Types of Sensor
- **Propriocpetive:** Measures internal state of system. (Eg. Gyroscope)
- **Exteroceptive:** Measures external environment. (Eg. GPS)

- **Passive:** Measures ambient environment. (Eg. Camera)
- **Active:** Measures response of environment to energy emitted from a sensor. (Eg. Ultrasonic sensor)

## Sensor Performance
Remember SCEAP!
- **Sensitivity:** Degree to which change in target input results in a sensor output.
- **Cross-Sensitivity:** Sensitivity to external disturbance from environment.
- **Error:** Deviation between actual and measured value
	2 main types of error:
	- Systematic: Errors that can be modeled and compensated for.
	- Random: Error that can be modeled probabilistically.
	````
	Error = m - v

	m = measured value
	v = actual value
	````


- **Accuracy:** Conformity between actual value and measured value.
	````
	accuracy = 1 - (|error|/v)
	````
- **Precision:** Degree of agreement between multiple measurements of the same environment state.
