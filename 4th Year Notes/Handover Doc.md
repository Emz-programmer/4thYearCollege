# Captain
---
TLDR of captain is that you're in charge, you'll represent the club for clubs and socs meetings, and for isaa meetings. I threw in a lot of detail since next years committee is pretty much 100% new people and you haven't been on committee long. So don't panic, it sounds like a lot, but it's straightforward. I winged captain, Don't do what I did and basically solo 90% of committee roles. Delegate responsibility and share the load. Make sure your committee members are doing their job.

## Goals
You're captain, it's your call what happens with the club. The club has been on a downwards trajectory pretty much since I joined. I did what I could last year to get some sort of recovery started. You can follow these goals, or set your own. But the club needs to have a lot more momentum if it's going to survive after you finish up in maynooth.
- Advertise training and events
- Use the club insta
- Encourage new members to compete
- Get peopple shooting recurve and compound
- Encourage people (especially if they show a lot of interest) to get a bow

## Training
You'll have to request training times from the sports office when the email goes out in early october. You can book the hall for a few hours per week before you get the permanent booking. Work with your committee to get time slots where at least 2 people can be present to supervise. How you format training is up to you. Personally I think we should follow what other clubs are doing:
- Beginner Training (As often as needed)
	- Must be completed by all new club members
	- Committee focus on training new members 
	- All targets at the close range mark
	- Health and Safety -> Shoot, Collect, Fast, Shooting line, Don't dry fire, don't point bows at people.
	- Equipment -> Run through what quiverr, arm guards, and finger tabs do, stringing and de-stringing.
	- Shooting -> Nocking, drawing, aiming, releasing 
	- Advertise that the beginner sessions are happening. Do like 2 or 3 for the first week or two of semesters and then aditional sessions if needed
- Open Training
	- Standard club training open to all who have completed a beginner session
	- Encourage people to get involved in the club/competitions
	- Run fun events/activities weekly
	- You can train beginners during it at your own discression 
	- Take turns supervising new archers but feel free to shoot if you want
- Team Training
	- Club session dedicated for archers heading to competitions
	- Focus on shooting, not on supervising beginners
	- Ideally the Keith session
	- Remember to prep for teams/head to heads for Trinity and Cork
	- Keep it to like 1 session a week
- Up you you how you run stuff, remember you have a committee to help you!
- Also make sure to leave 15/20 minutes to take down the equipment
I'd keep all but 1 training open, and just agree as a commitee when you want to take an open session and use it for beginners.
If money is looking tight for the club, or you want to keep a steady flow of money into the club, you can charge for training sessions. We used to charge €2 for the Keith sessions to help absorb the cost of hiring him.
Other thing, make sure cliques/circle time doesn't happen (Especially between committee members during open trainings). It's really offputting to new members, so chat with people to make them feel like part of the club. 

## Intervarsities (IV's)
Goal for next year is to get good numbers heading to competitions. So encourage people to go, especially if they're showing a lot of interest. 
**Members attending IV's MUST have an AI GoMembership account and get the free ISAA Membership**
Emails go out 2 weeks before the competition. Rule of thumb is that dublin colleges are on early shoot for dublin IV's (DCU,UCD,TCD,IADT,ITC). Dublin colleges are usually late shoot for non Dublin Shoots (NUIG,UCC,UL,UU,GMIT).
When the shooting list request comes in, just do this:
- Create a sign up sheet on Google Forms (I'll send you the updated login when you take over)
	- Full Name, Bow, Gender, Category, Alergies, Phone number (for whatsapp)
	- Set a price for competition (Remember that cork is expensive)
		- IV's are going to be €15 per student, plus whatever the bus costs
- Email out the sign up sheet (include details for the competition) also throw it on the club discord
- Set a deadline before the deadline set by the club (Usually a week before the competition)
- You can collect money before the IV, or on the bus to the IV. There will also be a payment system on MU life if it's easier for people to pay online.
- Get the list sent off to the club before the deadline
- Get your transport officer to plan out transport to/from venue
	- For DCU/UCD/Trinity We can commute from maynooth
- Sometimes Dublin colleges will group together and share a bus (that will be in captians chat, make sure to pass it on to transport officer if that's happening) 
- Set a meetup point (Club members are free to make their own way, just make sure they let you know)
- Make a group chat
- At the IV do a group warm up and a little pep talk especially if there are new members shooting. Hands in the middle, do the MOO chant!!! 
- Check in with your team, especially the newer members to make sure they're ok. The first competition for someone is always the hardest
- Take lots of pics, and a team pic (Put them on the insta)
- If you can't make an IV, designate either your Vice Captain, or an Committee Exec (Secretary/Treasurer) to act as captain for you.

Other thing to note, for IV's, Clubs are guaranteed 10 archers, and everything after is at the host's disgression. So order your shooting list by skill.

## Events
Events are going to be really important to keep the club alive especially with 2022/23 (hopefully) being Covid free. Aim to host events once every week or 2. These can be anything you can think of. If it's an awareness week for the SU like SHAG week or Mental Health week, make sure you theme the shoot around those. Collabs are also a great way to boost presence especially if you have friends running other clubs/socs. Few events I wanted to run but couldn't this year:
- Games Soc collab -> Tic tac toe with three 3 spot targets at close range
- Disney Soc collab -> Watch brave or an archery themed disney movie
- Shoot the stigma -> Mental Health week, write stigmas on a sticky note and shoot them (Can collab with mental health soc)
- Cupids arrow -> Valentines day, shoot heart shaped targets, maybe run a little competition with small heart/arrow themed prizes
- Beginner league/shoot -> €2 to enter, 30 arrows, prizes for top 3
Of course, make up your own events too, or if committee members have ideas take them into account too. Remember that these are fun light hearted shoots!
## Fundraising
Always a good idea, you call on what you want to do. You can do a bakesale with the proceeds going to the club and SU charity of the year (We did a 50/50 split). Can do a charity shoot. It's good for the club to earn points
## Cork (Student Nationals)
Cork is on the 18th/19th Feburary 2023. **BOOK THE HOTEL BEFORE CHRISTMAS** (Don't do what I did) (Also remember to use your transport officer). Jury's Inn is the best, if possible avoid the Rezz. Get enough rooms for around 10-12 people (I'm hoping for good more numbers next year). 2 or 3 person rooms with individual beds. For alocating rooms, generally don't mix genders. And make sure everyone is happy and comfortable sharing rooms with eachother. Since cork is expensive and students are broke, you can take a deposit in like december, and then the second payment before you head to cork. Also fundraisers can help lessen the cost of cork for members.
## Open Days/Trainings/Clubs and Socs Day
The Mary's and the SU will have a bunch of trainings and events throughout the year. Try your best to attend the various trainings and get a presence at the open days. For open days you can rock up and set up a few bows and chat. If you want to get some toy bows with the foam arrows and use that as a fun/safe way to do some shooting. Clubs and socs day happens in the second or third week of each semester. Set up a timetable so that there's at least 1 person running the stand. It's a great way to get new members into the club.
## Captains Chat
There's a group chat for all the club captains, that's how stuff is co-ordinated. it's usually on Messenger so get yourself a facebook account to keep up to date with that.
## Clubs/Socs Presidents Chat
Like the captains chat, there's a chat for club/soc presidents, usually on messenger. Great way to organise collabs or promote events.
## Halloween Shoot
Since it's a fun shoot, technically we don't need judges, but if you want to make it wrs for the fun, go ahead. Same categories as IV's Send out the shooting list requests at least 2 weeks before 29th October 2022. Hall is fully booked (make sure to remind the sports office that it's happening so phoenix is unlocked). For the shooting list, make sure it's sent out to the clubs as soon as possible. 
- Dublin Colleges are on Early shoot
- Rural Colleges are on Late shoot
- Use mooth people to fill in the gaps
- Print out the score cards (we have clipboards in the locker)
It will be mostly dublin colleges since it's a fun shoot. You will need to rent butts/stands to get enough targets for people. AI have butts and stands that will need to be collected/delivered to/from maynooth. Set up the hall on friday night.
- Set up targets right up against the net
- Measure 18m and use masking tape to mark out the shooting line
- Mark out equipment and 3m lines.
- Set up the 2 monitors in the locker for the archery timer (we should have all the cables needed)
- If anyone has a good speaker, use it for the buzzer
- Tape over the wires for health & safety
- Print out signs for the different lines
Reason we don't use the usual training marks is to maximise space for archers. Order medals too and get prizes for best costume (the medals were tara's idea and ngl they worked out amazing last time). 
Depending on time and numbers, you might be able to use the zombie targets and do a round robin shoot off. Hall is booked until 6pm so make sure everything is taken down by then. Rough schedule is:
````
9:00 Early shoot registration
9:30 Early shoot starts
12:00 Early shoot finished
12:30 Late shoot registration
13:00 Late shoot starts
15:30 Late shoot finished
15:45 Shoot off (Optional, will take no more than an hour)
then prizes and clean up the hall!
Make sure everything is cleared up before 6pm

````
Not 100% sure but the new IV fees are €15 idk if fun shoots are bound to that. But if it is, then €2 out of each €15 goes to the ISAA pending the egm agreeing on what's happening.
## Locker Access
It's your call who has locker access, but remember there's expensive equipment in there. Only people who need locker access should have it. So Secretary, Treasurer, Vice Captain, Equipment Officer, and Health & Safety Officer would need it. There's a blue box and a green money box in the locker, that's where club cash is. Green box is usually for collecting money during events/training. Blue box pretty much stays in the locker unless the money needs to be counted. ISAA Pins are kept in the blue box too, the new ones will be €2.50 each when they arrive. Close the locker after setup and takedown.
## AGM/EGM
We run 2 AGM's a year, one in early september, one in late april. April AGM is to ellect the majority of next years committee (especially the exec roles). September AGM is to ellect any remaining roles and get first years on the committee (first year rep and OCM's). If an executive on the committee resigns then call an EMG to fill the role asap. Remember to encourage members to get involved with the committee. Make sure your secretary is taking the minutes. For voting use sheets of paper and count the votes. RON (Re-open Nominations) Should always be an option in the votes.
## Running the Club
A lot of the specifics I've thrown down. Basically keep on top of stuff. Ideally have a committee meeting every week or 2 to keep everything focused and organised. The capitation (Club money from MU) is for the club to pay for competitions, equipment, accomodation, and transport. Your treasurer is in charge of making sure all the money is accounted for. If you're paying for anything make sure to get a reciept or invoice. Keep checking in on them to make sure everything is up to date. Your secretary keeps eyes on the email. I'd personally say check once a week yourself, but your secretary should be the person telling you when emails come in. The clubs and socs office will have meetings for club chairpeople, go to them, or if you can't make them, get somone on committee to go instead.
I never got around to it properly when I was captain, but it would be awesome if you get club jerseys and hoodies. We used to use Akuma but they've gotten a tad expensive and they're UK based. I did look for other options, Azzurri and Kukri seem to be irish or eu based. The design files should be in the MU Life storage, But I do have a copy of them too.

You'll do great, you've got a committee to help you keep on top of things. If in doubt talk to the Mary's. And i'll be available to help/offer advice if you're stuck, just text me! You'll do great
