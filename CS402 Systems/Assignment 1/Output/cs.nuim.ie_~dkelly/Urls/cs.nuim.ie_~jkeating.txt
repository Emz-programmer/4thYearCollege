</B></FONT>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have research interests in Physiological Modelling including Artificial Neural Networks and Signal Processing, and in conjunction with my research group at NUIM and my collaborators, I am currently investigating optical and acousto-optical implementations of neural networks and associated algorithms. This research has been made possible through research funding obtained from Irish (Enterprise Ireland) and European (Esprit) agencies and, in particular, the 5<SUP>th</SUP> Framework project "ROPE" which was specifically concerned with optical implementations of artificial neural networks. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My group has successfully implemented two connectionist architectures, and has recently developed two new algorithms suitable for implementation of the generalized Hough transform, and the Hough transform. We have also demonstrated that it is possible to implement matrix-vector multiplication using an LCD panel, a CCD detector and an Acousto-Optic device, and utilise the recorded vector sum in an algorithm. I plan, with the aid of further research funding, to produce an optical co-processor, under computer control, which may be used for numerical calculation of this type.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also interested in the fundamental limits on the computation possible using such a co-processing system, and in particular, the effects of system noise on the computation. It has been demonstrated that artificial neural networks learning is enhanced when trained in the presence of noise, and my research group is currently investigating specific and general examples of training-with-noise for optical computing arrangements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that Optical Information Processing (OIP) will be an important future technology, as it provides inherently parallel computation, and plan to establish NUIM as a centre of excellence in OIP. This requires a substantial investment in personnel, laboratory facilities and management, and I am actively pursuing a number of avenues for funding this programme.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am interested in promoting Science and Computer Science for second-level students. In conjunction with colleagues in the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Tennessee State University, the Telescopes in Education Foundation, Raytheon ITSS, and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center propose to provide access to the NASA-sponsored Telescopes In Education (TIE) environment to Irish schools. The project objective is to provide real-time, hands-on, interactive access to about 20 telescopes thus promoting Science (in particular Astronomy) and Computer Science in second-level schools. The international team proposes to integrate the online telescopes seamlessly into one virtual observatory with worldwide access. They will develop and provide the services required to operate the facility, including a scheduling service, data manipulation tools, online proposal and review environments, and an online journal for publication of results. The NUI Maynooth team will be responsible for developing online services worldwide, including scheduling and data-manipulation software. Specialist image processing software usable by second-level students will be developed specifically for the project. Given the international nature of the project, both Spanish and English language user interfaces will be provided. Central to the operation of this project and facility is a Sun E450 server kindly donated by Sun Microsystems Strategic Software Development Centre in Dublin which develops key components for a wide range of Sun's software product lines.  Responsibilities of this centre include operating/networking systems development, webtop/desktop development, software localisation and system test for product lines including Solaris, Java, Thin Client and Information Appliance product lines and software localisation activities for markets worldwide.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have interests in emerging Telecom Technologies and their influence on the design of publicly-accessible software applications, for example, web-enabled software. I have developed and compared database-driven, web-enabled software that dynamically generate user interfaces for various clients. I am particularly interested in what is possible using current WWW browser technologies from a user-interaction perspective, and have been investigating the development of applications suitable for use by children (drawing, developing interacting and computing skills, and communicating technologies). I would also like to see the development of culturally adaptable user-interfaces, particularly in WWW environments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also interested in software development, and I am particularly interested in the developments in security and human computer interaction issues of Internet (Web) based software. I am currently investigating several techniques for secure provision of mobile code, and methods of secure communication. I am also investigating the various interaction mechanisms provided by web environments and their effects on user interface construction. I am very interested in the development of adaptive, multilingual user interfaces.</P>
