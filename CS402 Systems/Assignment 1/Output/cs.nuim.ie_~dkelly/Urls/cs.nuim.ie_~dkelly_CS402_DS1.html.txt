<CENTER><B>Introduction</B></CENTER>


<P>A<B> Distributed System</B> is composed of a collection of independent
processors that do not share physical memory or a clock. Each processor
has its own local memory and the processors communicate using local and
wide area networks.

<P>A <B>Distributed Operating System</B> attempts to make this architecture
seamless and transparent to the user to facilitate the sharing of heterogeneous
resources in an efficient, flexible and robust manner. Its aim is to shield
the user from the complexities of the architecture and make it appear to
behave like a timeshared centralized environment.

<P>Distributed Operating Systems offer a number of potential benefits over
centralized systems. The availability of multiple processing nodes means
that load can be shared or balanced across all processing elements with
the objective of <B>increasing throughput and resource efficiency</B>.
Data and processes can be replicated at a number of different sites to
<B>compensate for failure</B> of some nodes or to <B>eliminate bottlenecks</B>.
A well designed system will be able to <B>accommodate growth in scale</B>
by providing mechanisms for distributing control and data.

<P><B>Communication </B>is the central issue for distributed systems as
all process interaction depends on it. Exchanging messages between different
components of the system incurs delays due to data propagation, execution
of communication protocols and scheduling. Communication delays can lead
to <B>inconsistencies </B>arising between different parts of the system
at a given instant in time making it difficult to gather global information
for decision making and making it difficult to distinguish between what
may be a delay and what may be a failure.

<P><B>Fault tolerance</B> is an important issue for distributed systems.
Faults are more likely to occur in distributed systems than centralized
ones because of the presence of communication links and a greater number
of processing elements, any of which can fail. The system must be capable
of reinitializing itself to a state where the <B>integrity of data </B>and
state of <B>ongoing computation</B> is preserved with only some possible
<B>performance degradation</B>.

<P>A distributed architecture consisting of heterogeneous hardware with
the complexity problems hinted at above is a potentially very unfriendly
platform for a user. The <B>principle of transparency</B> is used at many
levels in the design of a distributed system to mask implementation details
and complexities from the user. This ranges from providing the ability
to access local and remote devices in a uniform way, independent of location
to automated data and process replication, load balancing and recovery.
The goal of a distributed operating system is to provide a high-performance
and robust computing environment with the least awareness of the management
and control of distributed resources but with the flexibility to manipulate
the environment if required.&nbsp;<A NAME="index"></A>
